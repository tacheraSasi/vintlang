# GoReleaser Issues Fixed - Summary

This document summarizes the issues that were found and fixed in the GoReleaser configuration and workflow.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Configuration Version Mismatch (CRITICAL)

**Problem**: The `.goreleaser.yml` file specified `version: 2`, but the current version of GoReleaser (v1.26.2) only supports `version: 1` configuration files.

**Error Message**: 
```
⨯ command failed error=only configurations files on version: 1 are supported, 
  yours is version: 2, please update your configuration
```

**Solution**: Changed `version: 2` to `version: 1` in `.goreleaser.yml`

**Impact**: This was preventing any GoReleaser commands from working, including builds and releases.

---

### 2. Test Script PATH Issue

**Problem**: The `scripts/test-goreleaser.sh` script would install GoReleaser to `~/go/bin/` but this directory wasn't guaranteed to be in the PATH, causing the `goreleaser` command to fail.

**Error Message**:
```
goreleaser: command not found
```

**Solution**: Added `export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"` to the beginning of the script.

**Impact**: The test script now works reliably regardless of the user's PATH configuration.

---

### 3. Missing Documentation

**Problem**: There was no documentation explaining:
- How to use GoReleaser for releases
- What the GitHub Actions workflow does
- How to test releases locally
- How to troubleshoot issues

**Solution**: Created comprehensive documentation:
- `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` - Complete release workflow guide
- `docs/GORELEASER_QUICK_START.md` - Quick reference guide
- Updated `README.md` with contributing section

**Impact**: Maintainers now have clear instructions for creating releases.

---

## Verification

All fixes have been tested and verified:

✅ **Configuration Validation**: `goreleaser check` passes successfully
✅ **Single Platform Build**: Builds correctly for Linux amd64
✅ **Multi-Platform Build**: Builds for all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
✅ **Archive Generation**: Creates tar.gz and zip archives correctly
✅ **Package Generation**: Creates deb, rpm, and apk packages
✅ **Checksum Generation**: Generates SHA256 checksums correctly
✅ **Test Script**: `./scripts/test-goreleaser.sh` works end-to-end
✅ **Binary Functionality**: Built binaries execute correctly

## How to Use GoReleaser Now

### Test Locally
```bash
./scripts/test-goreleaser.sh
```

### Create a Release
```bash
./scripts/release.sh v0.3.0
```

### Manual Commands
```bash
# Validate configuration
goreleaser check

# Quick build (single platform)
goreleaser build --snapshot --clean --single-target

# Full build (all platforms)
goreleaser release --snapshot --clean --skip=publish
```

---

## GitHub Actions Workflow

The workflow at `.github/workflows/build.yml`:

1. **Triggers on**: Tags matching `v*` (e.g., v0.3.0, v1.0.0)
2. **Test Job**: Sets up Go environment and validates the build can succeed
3. **Release Job**: 
   - Runs GoReleaser to build all platforms
   - Creates archives and packages
   - Generates checksums
   - Publishes to GitHub Releases
   - Auto-generates release notes

---

## Platform Support

GoReleaser is configured to build for:

| Operating System | Architectures | Package Formats |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Linux           | amd64, arm64, 386 | tar.gz, deb, rpm, apk |
| macOS           | amd64, arm64  | tar.gz |
| Windows         | amd64, 386    | zip |

**Excluded combinations**:
- Windows arm64 (not supported by Go)
- macOS 386 (deprecated by Apple)

---

## Future Improvements

While the GoReleaser configuration is now working, here are some potential improvements for the future:

1. **Docker Support**: The workflow has Docker login but `.goreleaser.yml` doesn't build Docker images. Either:
   - Remove Docker login from workflow (if not needed)
   - Add Docker configuration to goreleaser (if wanted)

2. **Testing**: The test job doesn't run actual tests. Consider:
   - Uncommenting the Go vet checks
   - Adding unit tests
   - Running integration tests

3. **Changelog**: Consider using conventional commits for better auto-generated changelogs

4. **Homebrew**: Add Homebrew tap support for easier macOS installation

5. **Scoop**: Add Scoop manifest for easier Windows installation

## Summary

The GoReleaser configuration is now **fully functional** and ready for production use. Maintainers can:

1. Test releases locally with `./scripts/test-goreleaser.sh`
2. Create releases with `./scripts/release.sh vX.Y.Z`
3. Trust that GitHub Actions will build and publish automatically when tags are pushed

All build artifacts (binaries, archives, packages, checksums) are generated correctly for all supported platforms.
